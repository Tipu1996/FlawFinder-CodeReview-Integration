# Flawfinder Code Security Analysis Integration

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an automated security analysis process using Flawfinder, a powerful open-source code review tool, designed to enhance code security for C/C++ projects. The integration is designed to seamlessly fit into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring code quality and security with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Efficient Code Review**: Flawfinder is used to identify common security pitfalls and vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, enhancing code quality and security.
- **Automated Process**: Integration with GitLab and Github Actions automates code security analysis, making it an integral part of your development workflow.
- **Transparency and Accessibility**: Results of code analysis are transparently displayed within Github Actions, facilitating early issue resolution.
- **Reproducibility**: Docker containers ensure consistent and reproducible code analysis across different environments.
